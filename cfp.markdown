We welcome original research papers of up to 4 pages in length, formatted according to [the IJCAI-PRICAI 2020 guidelines](https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit).
We also welcome extended abstracts of up to 2 pages that describe open problems and challenges in the area of knowledge-based RL.
The papers will be non-archival, which means we welcome papers that have been published or submitted to other conferences and journals.
However, authors are required to acknowledge their papers' original appearance in such cases.

All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as posters.
The program committee will select a few papers for oral presentation.
There will be a poster session during the scheduled coffee breaks to facilitate and spark discussions amongst attendees.
